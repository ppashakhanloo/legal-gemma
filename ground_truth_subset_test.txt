Context: The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.

Context: California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure

ViaSat Inc. is committed to ensuring that its supply chain represents its values and respect for human rights. To that end, our Guide to Business Conduct provides:

ViaSat’s supplier relationships are based on lawful, efficient and fair practices. We expect our suppliers to obey the laws that require them to treat workers fairly and provide a safe and healthy work environment. ViaSat will not knowingly use any supplier that uses forced, prison, or indentured labor. ViaSat will only work with suppliers who comply with all laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which the suppliers are doing business.

ViaSat implements this policy by obligating its suppliers to certify that they are compliant with these concepts. Further, ViaSat contractually obligates its suppliers to “not utilize forced, prison, or indentured labor, or subject workers to any form of compulsion or coercion” and to “comply with all laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which Seller is doing business.” ViaSat’s suppliers are obligated to flow these requirements to their suppliers as well.

Key personnel in ViaSat’s procurement department receive training on how to identify human trafficking and forced labor issues. Although ViaSat does not have a formal audit program, these personnel are trained to recognize health, safety, and labor red flags, including red flags relating to forced labor, and to report and investigate all suspicions of improper conduct.

Suppliers that fail to meet the contractual requirements set forth above are terminated. Employees who violate ViaSat’s Guide to Business Conduct are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

Answer the Question based on the given Context.
Context: Throwaway here.  About five months ago, we moved into a house that has five bedrooms with one bigger master bedroom/bath, and four other roughly equally sized rooms. Five people moved into this house initially, with myself and my SO living in the master bedroom.   After we signed the lease (with only four of us on it, myself, SO, and two others) we tried to come to an agreement on who would pay what on how the rent was divided, all done through a group message. Because the top two incomes on the lease weren't enough, we needed a cosigner on the lease, which my family member stepped in to be. What we eventually decided on, was that SO and I would pay 460 for the master, and each upstairs bedroom would be 410. I would also subsidize the cost of the upstairs bedroom that was going unoccupied by paying an additional 410 a month, with the explicitly defined understanding that if we ever filled that fifth bedroom with a sixth person, that person would be paying the 410 instead and no one that is staying in an upstairs bedroom for 410 has their rent changed at all.  Everyone in the group message, in writing, agreed to this. I have screenshots.   Now we've picked up a sixth roommate, and the roommates have begun talking about renegotiating the spread of the rent. I brought up the screenshotted conversation and agreement we made months earlier that everyone agreed to, and two of the roommates said that this was now "unfair" and we should renegotiate. The other roommate flat out rejected all of our negotiations for various reasons, and ultimately said if we couldn't come to an agreeable resolution, he would be moving out at the end of the month. In writing, I asked if he was going to move his stuff out, stop residing at the residence, and stop paying rent, even though his name was the one on the lease, and he said yes, so now I have written confirmation.  The other roommates are also unhappy with the fact that we want to stick with the original agreement we all agreed to, but they have not threatened to move out.  If he does end up moving out, I'm afraid the cosigner and I will be held responsible for paying for this guy's rent while he gets off scot free to live wherever else he chooses. If we don't pay it, then we get evicted within 3 days of the rent being due.   Currently looking, but there so far don't seem to be any prospects that are taking over his room.  What options do I have? Am I shit out of luck? If he moves out, violating the terms of the lease, can I pay his portion for the rest of the lease and go after him for it in small claims? I legitimately don't know, and it doesn't look like a compromise will be reached any time soon. Any help would be appreciated.

I asked WHAT ? Yesterday he told me that the agreement he wrote down would suffice the writ. I am so confused as what to do now.

Context: Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We dont share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.

Context: I was set to graduate from college within the prescribed 4 years. The final classes I needed to graduate were not offered at my university (small liberal arts college). I missed out on registering for the classes at another school so my time in school was to be extended by a semester. The financial aid office and business offices at my school are terrible. They took forever to get back to me and since I was over 21 they requested dependent verification paperwork. This all took place halfway through the final semester. I had filled out all requirements on my part to receive my financial aid. The only thing I needed to submit was my mother’s tax return forms. Well since I had not graduated on time my mother was upset and kicked me out of her house. So there I was in school, homeless and broke so I stopped attending classes.   Now I am 10,000 in debt outside of student loans with the school. My concern is how is this possible if I never approved my financial aid (loans). The fault lies in the bad timing on the school’s part. It takes them far too long to communicate with students. Is there anything I can do? I am in too much debit to ignore this and not get a degree. Especially considering the quality of education at the school is a joke and everybody cheats.   I don’t want to come off as vindictive but my attempts at speaking to the administration have not yielded any results. What can I do to make them listen? Will contacting the accreditation bureau help? I want to include legal action but so far that is a hollow threat with the condition of my finances. Should I get legal representation or find another way to handle this?

Context: Please no judgement here, I really don't know what to do and I need some solid advice.  Before I start I want to say I realize this whole situation is mostly my fault and I am not skirting blame, I just need an idea of what to do next.  Okay, I'm 26 I have had a wellsfargo savings account since I was 14.  When I was in high school hey started pressuring me to get a checking account and a debit card and I didn't want to but they harassed me for six months until I got one.  They then told me my info was going to get stolen online so I had to get an "online debit card" (I was 18 at the time and I grew up poor so I didn't know this was not a good idea) hey also said that if I had this "online debit card" then I won't get charged for having a checking account (something they were charging me for unknown to me and unknown to me they were charging me monthly for the online card as well.  Flash forward a couple years and they start offering me a credit card, I turned it down multiple times but they had me go back and talk to a banker and he started trying to scare me into getting one saying things like "what if you have an emergency? What if you get stranded? Etc" and finally I have in because they said it was the lowest interest you could get because it was a student credit card but they still gave me a huge interest rate and I didn't realize because it was my first one and my family never had credit cards.  A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.  Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.  It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.  It's been a few months and now wellsfargo is suing me for $7,000 and their attorney fees.    I don't have money to pay them unless I do $50 over 5 years with no interest, otherwise I have to declare bankruptcy because if they garnish my wages I won't be able to eat...  I don't know why to do guys, I'm so stressed and I recognize that my ignorance of finances got me here but I really need help getting back out.  Any advice or help you can offer would help me so much.  Thank you all, I didn't know where else to turn.

Answer the Question based on the given Context.
Context: I'll try to make this as short and factual as possible.   July 2016- Bankruptcy was declared and granted last year. In that, we lost personal liability in the home. We turned off all water, utilities, and contacted the mortgage company to advice them we were leaving state and leaving the home. We advised them we wanted to give it back and could no longer afford it. We have not made a payment since two months prior before the move. Not to escrow, taxes, nothing. I called and cancelled the homeowners insurance. I received paperwork stating it was cancelled and that money was refunded to the escrow.  July this year- The mortgage company turned the mortgage over to a new company that has sent us a deed in lieu of sale packet we need to sign to give them the home.  While checking our banking online (our bank also had our mortgage) I discovered a claim on the house. In it, it states there was a burglary/theft that occurred in October 2016. There is also an estimate for the bathrooms for repair and that appears to be the claim of damage. **I never received a call, I never consented to anything, and I cancelled the homeowners insurance.**  To further complicate things, I don't believe the home was broken into. Two of the three bathrooms had hidden water damage when we bought the house and moved in. A piece of ceiling fell in one right after we bought it, and we discovered black mold. We ripped down all drywall and treated the underlying wood. We had not replaced it yet because my husband lost his job, shit hit the fan, bankruptcy, etc, etc. The second bathroom had hidden damage in the sink and when we turned the water back on when we moved in, it became apparent so the vanity was ripped out (and fell apart when it was removed). We purchased all new items for that bathroom and as far as we know are still sitting in the garage of the house. We left that with the home because it belonged to it, just wasn't installed. When questioned on the phone with the current company about the state of the home, we told them this.   We are supposed to sign and mail the deed in leiu of sale package today or the house is supposed to go forward with the forclosure.   I can't afford a lawyer to ask about this, so I just want to know if anyone knows what the process will be in all of this. I have never been contacted once about the "burglary" claim and I can't tell for sure if it was a real break in or not. I'm across the continent now and I have no way of getting to the home. It's under the care of the mortgage company now and has been since we left in July 2016.  Is it better to allow it to go to forclosure, since I have no personal responsibility in the home and all claims will go against the property and not me? Do I continue and sign? Do I call? What do I ask? The mortgage and insurance company are the same ones still technically. The mortgage was originally USAA and now it's Nationstar, which is owned by USAA.   Any help that doesn't just say "lawyer now" is appreciated. I know that a lawyer is best. I know I need one. I can't get one, period.

Context: Hello, this is a follow-up to my earlier post (I deleted it though). Basically, the story starts last week on the 24th when I signed a lease with a student apartment complex. I signed it electronically at 12:07 p.m. and I have a copy of it.    At 1:06 p.m. that same day, about an hour later, I get a call from one of their staff saying they ran out of units and I would have to be put on a wait list. I missed the call and called right back, unaware that he had left a voicemail. After that, I signed with another apartment complex so that I would have a place to stay for the semester, as I have less than a month before the term begins.    When I tried to explain to one of their managers what happened, they refused to terminate my lease. They said that I was told I was the last unit, and I have one now, so I have to pay the rent. I told them someone from their office called me an hour later and told me they had ran out and that I was going to be put on a wait list. I missed the call at first, but I called right back and I asked to be put on the wait list.    The manager told me they cannot cancel leases and that I had to pay. He said they don't know who told me there was no spots left, but I was not on the wait list at all. Not only that, he told me I was told I was the last unit even though there is no record of this at all. No voicemail, no email, nothing. Only a rent reminder after the person had told me there was no spots left, and I had not been assigned a unit then. When I made a fuss about this is when they told me I had gotten the last unit, not before. I couldn't remember the guy's name, so obviously they thought I was lying and just wanting to get out of my lease. I didn't know he had left a voicemail, so I resigned myself to the fact I had no proof.    Earlier today, though, I guess my notifications for my voicemail started working again. I got the name of the community member who told me they were out of spots and that I could be put on the waiting list. I also have a screenshot of when the voicemail was sent (on the 24th, at 1:06 after I had signed my lease).    The only reason I signed another lease is because they told me they were out of spots to put me in. Am I still obligated to pay rent even though they told me that?    Thank you.
